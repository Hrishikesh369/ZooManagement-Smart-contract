# ZooManagement

This is a basic Zoo Management Solidity smart contract built on Foundry development framework .

## Summary
ZooManagement contract stores animals and tracks visitor counts. It's intentionally simple, anyone can add animals and update visitor count unless you add access control. This is my introductory project to Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity

## Functionality

- Update visitor count
  
- Get total visitor count
  
- Add different animals (species, name, age) to a dynamic array and map animal name to age
